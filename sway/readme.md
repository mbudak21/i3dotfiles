This is my minimal sway config. I started with the default config of sway and modified it to my liking by mostly applying settings from my i3 config. The result is nearly identical to the i3 config, but uses wayland tools. 

Here are some of the dependencies:
- CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font
- alacritty
- bemenu
- swaylock
- grim
- slurp
- wl-clipboard
- wob (see the config file, wob.ini)
- pamixer
- amixer
- playerctl
- xbacklight
- i3blocks (see the config file, i3blocks/config)
